## About Me
#### I am very new to all things IT and data analytics, but I have a keen interest in learning. I enjoy to read. I read most genres, however my favorite would have to be short fiction. I also like to go on Walks, outdoor skating, and creating craftes such as arts and sewing as fun pasttimes with friends.
### Goals for this course
#### - Mastering how to think like a programmer by the end of this course
#### - Mastering Python 
#### - Finding employment 
#### - Conquering my fear of learning the unknown, unseen, and uncharted paths of what could be the start of an incredible career path for myself.
